# Driver writing for I2C interfacing of ADXL345 sensor

# Prerequisite for the project
  For these files to run we need raspberry pi running on linux kernel. To update and build the kernel use [link](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html). First remove the loaded module. 
  Command to remove the module is "sudo rmmod adxl.ko" 
  
  List of softwares used for this project's implementation:
  1. Putty
  2. WinSCP
  3. Vnc viewer
 
# Summary
  The aim of this project to write a driver to read the data from ADXL345 sensor interfaced using I2C protocol to raspberry pi 4 (1GB).
  
# Introduction  
  I2C stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit.I2C protocol is widely used for interfacing peripheral devices. I2C is a two wired protocol with one wire as "SCL" used for carrying       clock signal and other wire is "SDA" used for transferring data serially. I2C is a master slave protocol which means that the communication will always be initiated by the         master and in total we can connect 128 slaves. SMBus (System Management Bus) protocol is based on I2C. Most I2C devices work on SMBus but the reverse is not true.

  Hardware consists of RaspberryPi 4 and ADXL345 sensor.

# Kernel Driver
  The project focuses on the implementation of the client side driver.
  1. Adapter Driver - The adapter driver effectively represents a bus. It is used to effectively tie up a particular algorithm with a bus number.
  2. Client Driver - Client represents the slave connected to the I2C bus. The method used to build the client driver is such that only the driver knows information of the device being connected and as soon as it finishes its like the device no longer existed in the system contrary to the device tree implementation. i2c_smbus read/write word/byte functions are used to communicate with adxl.
  
  In total 6 ioctl calls are implemented.
  1. IMU_ACC - Obtain all the accleration values (x,y,z) from the adxl sensor.
  2. IMU_ACC_X - Obtain all x acceleration from the adxl sensor.
  3. IMU_ACC_Y - Obtain all y acceleration from the adxl sensor.
  4. IMU_ACC_Z - Obtain all z acceleration from the adxl sensor.
  5. IMU_STANDBY - Make the adxl sensor go into standby mode.
  7. IMU_MEASURE - Make the adxl sensor go into measurement mode.

# Register Configurations
  1. First the Power control register is written to, to go in standby mode.
  2. Then the 0x00 register is read and the ID of adxl345 is verified.
  3. 0x04 is written to data format register to make data left justified.
  4. 0x08 is written to Power Control register to go into measurement mode.
  5. Registers are read and modified according to the ioctl calls.
  6. For reading acceleration values regiters 0x32-0x37 are read.

  ADXL745 can be connected to any available "SDA" and "SCL" lines of raspberryPi 4 board that can be identified from the GPIO pin assignment and GPIO alternate functionality       table of [RaspberryPi 4 datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rpi4/raspberry-pi-4-datasheet.pdf). 
  Following is the GPIO pin assignment diagram.

  Connection Table:
  
  | ADXL Pin | RaspberryPi Pin |
  | --- | --- |
  | VCC | Pin 1 (3.3 V)|
  | Ground | Pin 39 |
  | SCL | Pin 3 |
  | SDA | Pin 5|
  
 # Use Instructions
   1. Connect the sensor according to the schematic diagram or connection table and connect the RaspberryPi 4 board using ethernet cable.
   2. Open putty and connect to the board using Hostname or IP address.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91187808/145359917-9f3e5310-ddf1-442f-b191-c72cf7c452ca.png)
   3. Login using username: pi and password: raspberry. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91187808/145360147-afe4627f-dc61-4708-a586-c68ff15f9d0c.png)
   4. Once you are inside the pi board access your folder using putty terminal. For creating and moving file from host computer to RaspberryPi 4 board one can use [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php).
   5. Winscp Terminal will look like:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91187808/145360719-025f612f-0c51-450d-a408-77375727b1a1.png)
   6. Compile all the files using "make" command.
   7. Insert the module to kernel using command "sudo insmod adxl.ko".
   8. Check if the module is correctly inserted using command "lsmod".
   9. Give the rights to the user to open the device file using command "sudo chmod 777 /dev/adxl".
   10. Run the userspace program using command "./usrapp".
   11. If there is no error you will be able to see the sensor reading.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91187808/145360991-494f856e-31d4-479a-8653-1f0aff9daae9.png)
   12. To check the status of the registers (to verify standby/measurement mode)
      12.1. First remove the module using "sudo rmmod adxl".
      12.2. To view status of Power Control register use "i2cget -y 1 0x53 0x2D".
